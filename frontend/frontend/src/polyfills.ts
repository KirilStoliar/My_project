/**
 * This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and is loaded before the app.
 * You can add your own extra polyfills to this file.
 *
 * This file is divided into 2 sections:
 *   1. Browser polyfills. These are applied before loading ZoneJS and are sorted by browsers.
 *   2. Application imports. Files imported after ZoneJS that should be loaded before your main
 *      file.
 *
 * The current setup is for so-called "evergreen" browsers; the last versions of browsers that
 * automatically update themselves. This includes Safari >= 10, Chrome >= 55 (including Opera),
 * Edge >= 13 on the desktop, and iOS 10 and Chrome on mobile.
 *

/**
 * By default, zone.js will patch all possible macroTask and DomEvents
 * user can disable parts of macroTask/DomEvents patch by setting following flags
 * because those flags need to be set before `zone.js` being loaded, and webpack
 * puts this import at the top of the entry point, so user code can't require
 * these flags.
 *
 * This file imports all flags; you can selectively disable them in your app by:
 * import './polyfills';
 *
 * Before zone.js:
 *  (window as any).__Zone_disable_requestAnimationFrame = true; // disable patch requestAnimationFrame
 *  (window as any).__Zone_disable_on_property = true; // disable patch onProperty such as onclick
 *  (window as any).__Zone_disable_timers = true; // disable patch timer APIs
 *  (window as any).__Zone_disable_IE_check = true; // disable patch IE check
 *  (window as any).__Zone_disable_XHR = true; // disable patch XMLHttpRequest
 *
 *  (window as any).__Zone_enable_cross_context_check = true;
 *
 *  (window as any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove'];
